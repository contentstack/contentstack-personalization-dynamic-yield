# Implementing Personalization Using Dynamic Yield on Contentstack-powered Websites

Contentstack is a headless CMS with an API-first approach that puts content at the centre. It is designed to simplify the process of publication by separating code from content.

Personalization is a powerful marketing tool that helps marketing and product teams to create variants for their website pages to engage customers. Through the results of these experiments, they can gauge which variations work best so that the overall customer experience can be enhanced.

In recent times, personalization has become more of a necessity than an option. Therefore, businesses have started using various personalization tools to help gain competitive advantage.
